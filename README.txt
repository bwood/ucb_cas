PURPOSE
-------

UCB CAS is a collection of modules needed use UC Berkeley CalNet
authentication and UC Berkeley LDAP with a Drupal site. Once UCB CAS
is enabled logging into your site via CalNet should "just work."

Branches
--------

The drupal.org git strategy is not to use the master branch.  Click on
the github Branches tab to get to the 6.x and 7.x branches. The
READMEs on the branches are a lot more entertaining.

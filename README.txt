PURPOSE
-------

UCB CAS is a collection of modules needed use UC Berkeley CalNet
authentication and UC Berkeley LDAP with a Drupal site. Once UCB CAS
is enabled logging into your site via CalNet should "just work."

IMPORTANT: When a user logs in via CalNet for the first time Drupal
will create an account for them and assign them to the "authenticated
user" role. Be very cautious with assigning the "authenticated user"
role any privileges beyond what the "anonymous user" role has. The
best way to manange privileges for your CalNet users is to create a
role like "editor" which is allowed to create content. You should then
review each new person in the "authenticated user" role and decide
whether or not to assign them your "editor" role.  (The Rules module
can be used to send you automatic emails each time a new user account
is created on your site.)

REQUIREMENTS
------------
The modules installed by UCB CAS are:

cas
cas_attributes (includes cas_ldap)
ldap_integration (includes ldapauth, ldapdata, ldapgroups)

Since UCB CAS installs multiple modules on your site, it's install
process will ensure that those modules do not already exist on your
site.  If conflicting files are found an friendly message will appear and the
installer will abort.

If you see this error message when you enable the module, check the
directories that drupal scans for module files
(e.g. sites/all/modules, sites/EXAMPLE/modules,
sites/modules/EXAMPLE/, profiles/EXAMPLE...) for conflicting modules.
If you find conflicts:

1. Disable the conflicting modules at admin/build/modules
2. Remove the files for the conflicting modules from your site
3. Enable UCB CAS
4. Run update.php

INSTALLING
----------

1. Download ucb_cas-X.x-X.x.tar.gz to the computer running your Drupal site.
2. Download the Drupal 6 version of token from http://drupal.org/project/token
3. Unarchive these modules in an appropriate directory like sites/all/modules.
4. Enable the module at admin/build/modules.  You ONLY need to enable
the UCB CAS module the other modules will be enabled and configured
for you.
5. Test your site:If your site runs at
http://example-dev.berkeley.edu, go to
http://example-dev.berkeley.edu/cas.  You should see the CAS login
page.  When you authenticate successfully you should be returned to
your Drupal site and you should see "Logged in as YOUR NAME."

Go to http://example-dev.berkeley.edu/user.  You should see the email
address that was retrieved from LDAP for your account.

UNINSTALLING
------------

To remove UCB CAS from your site do the following:

1. Disable the UCB CAS module at admin/build/modules. (You do not need
to disable each individual module that UCB CAS installed.)

2. Uninstall the UCB CAS module at admin/build/modules/uninstall.
This step will disable and uninstall each module that UCB CAS
installed.  It will also remove variables that UCB CAS added your
site's variables table.

CONFIGURATION DETAILS
---------------------

In order to make CAS and LDAP work out-of-the-box when you install UCB
CAS, we've made some configuration decisions for you.  These decisions
are aimed at defining "best practices" for using CAS and LDAP with
your Drupal site.  That said, if you don't like our decisions, you can
override them on the appropriate admin page on your site.

CAS Configuration at admin/user/cas:

  *Add CAS Link to Login Forms*
  
    The option "Make CAS login default on login forms" has been set by
    this module. If you have the User Login block enabled, non-logged
    in users wil only have the option to login via CalNet (CAS).
    
    If either of the other two options are selected, non-authenticated
    users will see the option to login using Drupal's standard
    authentication (username and password text inputs boxes).  The
    best practice for UC Berekely sites is to not present users with
    both CalNet and Drupal's standard authentication as login
    options. (See the IMPORTANT note below for more on this.)
  
  *Inital login destination* and *Logout destination*

     You may want to customize these. Feel free...

  *Users cannont change password*

     Unchecking this is very likely to cause confusion.  Users should
     change their passwords via CalNet. See *Change password URL*
     further down.

  *Drupal Login Invitation*

     This setting is blank because it can cause confusion.  It adds a
     link to your login block allowing users to login using Drupal's
     stadandard authentication instead of CalNet.  It's best to
     require ALL of your users to login via CAS and not to give them
     the option of nusing Drupal's authentication.  If you need to
     allow people who don't have a CalNet ID to login to your site,
     you can add a value like "Non-UCB people login here" to this text
     box.

     IMPORTANT: If you allow standard Drupal authentication to your
     site you MUST run your site at an https URL.  Failure to do so is
     a significant security risk yielding multiple
     vulnerabilities. For example, anyone logging into your site from
     a public wireless network can easily have their password stolen.

     (There is a module in the works to facilitte using both CAS and
     standard Drupal authentication on a site. Email
     ist-drupal@lists.berkeley.edu for more information.)

Cas Attributes configuration (admin/user/cas/attributes)

  *Fetch CAS Attributes*

       You can change this to "only when a CAS account is created
       (i.e., the first login of a CAS user)."  That means your site
       will not reflect changes made to LDAP after the user account
       was created on your site.

LAUNCHING YOUR SITE (IMPORTANT)
-------------------------------

	Your site is using the servers ldap-test.berkeley.edu and
	auth-test.berkeley.edu.  These are the correct servers to use
	for site development and testing.  When you make your site
	live, you should change these servers to ldap.berkeley.edu and
	auth.berkeley.edu. Make these changes at:

        admin/user/cas
        admin/user/cas/attributes

        (A module to help automate this is in the works.)
